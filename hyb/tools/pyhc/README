PYTHON HC FILE INTERFACE

A minimal Python module (the same as the HC library for C++) for
getting interpolated quantities from a simulation mesh contained in an
HC file. The Python module is made by using the wrapping tool called
SWIG, which actually generates the C code for the C extension.

If you want to run the scripts in the examples directory, you will
also have to install the packages python-scipy and python-matplotlib.

USING THE PYTHON MODULE

To import module to script use the commands:

import sys
sys.path.append("THIS STRING CONTAINS LOCATION OF _pyhc.so")
import pyhc

See examples/ directory for Python examples.
