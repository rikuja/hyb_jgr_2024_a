HYB HC TOOLS

HC tools are a set of programs to analyze and visualize files that are
in the HC (Hierarchical Cartesian) format produced by the HYB
simulation code. The programs are designed for the Linux environment
and the GUI uses Tcl/Tk and X libraries.

Folders:

hcvis/  : Interpolation and visualization of HC files
misc/   : Miscellaneous HC file and HYB log file tools
pyhc/   : Python interface for HC tools
src/    : HC format library
tracer/ : Test particle tracer using electric and magnetic fields
          interpolated from HC files

Programs:

hcvis    : 3-D visualization of HC files
hcintpol : 3-D interpolation (linear/zeroth order) of quantities from
           HC files at arbitrary points (x,y,z)
hc2*     : Convert HC files in other formats (experimental)
hyblog_* : Plot and create PDF files from HYB log files (uses gnuplot)

REQUIRED PACKAGES

Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (amd64)

Code in src/*, misc/* and hcvis/hcintpol require only:

g++

hcvis/hcvis requires:

libxi-dev
libxmu-dev
freeglut3-dev
tcl8.5-dev
tk8.5-dev

blt-dev package is needed for 1-D plotting in hcvis, but the current
BLT version on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS conflicts with Python version. Set
"HAVE_BLT = false" in hcvis/Makefile to deal with this error.

pyhc/* requires:

swig
swig-doc
swig-examples
python2.7-dev

COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION

Compiling all HC tools:

make all

Compiling all HC tools manually if needed:

cd ~/hyb/tools
make libs
cd hcvis
make all
make install
cd ../misc
make
make install
cd ../tracer
make
make install
cd ../pyhc
make

Setup paths:

echo export PATH=${PATH}:~/hyb/tools/bin/ >>~/.bashrc
echo export HCVIS_ROOT=~/hyb/tools/hcvis/ >>~/.bashrc

Compiling only hcintpol:

make hcintpol
